# Taguchi table generator

In Rust

Taguchi tables, or orthogonal arrays, are a way of efficiently running experiments with many
combinations of multiple variables.

[here](https://www.me.psu.edu/cimbala/me345/Lectures/Taguchi_orthogonal_arrays.pdf) for you.

I originally found about this method from the excellent NightHawkInLight on YouTube, specifically
